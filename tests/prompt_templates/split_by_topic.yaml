Summarize each story with as much detail as possible. Consider journalistic details like "Who, What, When, Where, Why, How."
It's better to return an empty list than it is to summarize a stories with scant details.
Crucial- Do not include individual stories lacking detail! You MUST be able to write at least 3 sentences about a singular story.
