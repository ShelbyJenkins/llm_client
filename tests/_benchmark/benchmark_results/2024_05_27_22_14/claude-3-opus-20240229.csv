22338,boolean,"If you ran a rope around the entire circumference of the earth, and wanted to raise it 1 meter off the ground, everywhere, you would only need 6.3 meters of extra rope.",true,false,false,,2,3,0.6666667,"The answer is: false.

To calculate the additional rope needed, we use the formula for circumference: C = 2πr, where r is the radius.

Let's say the original radius of the Earth is R. The new radius after raising the rope by 1 meter would be R + 1.

The difference in circumference is:
2π(R + 1) - 2πR = 2π(R + 1 - R) = 2π * 1 = 2π meters

2π is approximately 6.28 meters, not 6.3 meters. Therefore, the statement is false. You would need approximately 6.28 additional meters of rope, regardless of the Earth's radius.; The answer is: true

Justification: The circumference of a circle is proportional to its radius. Increasing the radius of the Earth by 1 meter would increase the circumference by 2π meters, which is approximately 6.28 meters. Therefore, you would need only about 6.3 meters of extra rope to raise it 1 meter off the ground around the entire Earth.; The answer is: false.

To calculate the additional rope needed, we use the formula for circumference: C = 2πr, where r is the radius.

Let's say the original radius of the Earth is R. The new radius after raising the rope by 1 meter would be R + 1.

The difference in circumference is:
2π(R + 1) - 2πR = 2πR + 2π - 2πR = 2π

Therefore, you would need an additional 2π meters of rope, which is approximately 6.28 meters, not 6.3 meters.",Basic

The man was a shipwreck survivor. He had been stranded on an island with two other men. As they ran out of food, they agreed that to survive, they would have to eat one of them. They decided to draw lots, and the man who walked into the restaurant was the ""lucky"" one who survived by eating his companions.

After being rescued and returning to civilization, he ordered a seagull in the restaurant, which triggered the traumatic memory of having to resort to cannibalism to survive. Overwhelmed by guilt and the horror of what he had done, he took his own life.

You reach down, you flip the tortoise over on its back. The tortoise lays on its back, its belly baking in the hot sun, beating its legs trying to turn itself over, but it can’t, not without your help. But you’re not helping. Why is that?",,"This is a reference to a scene from the movie ""Blade Runner"" (1982), directed by Ridley Scott. In the film, the character Rick Deckard (played by Harrison Ford) is interviewing a replicant named Leon Kowalski (played by Brion James) to determine if he is a replicant or a human. Deckard asks Leon this question about the tortoise as part of the Voight-Kampff test, which is designed to provoke an emotional response and thus reveal if the subject is a replicant or not.

The question is meant to evoke empathy and test the subject's emotional response. A human would likely feel compelled to help the tortoise, as it is a creature in distress. However, a replicant, being an artificial being, might not have the same emotional response and would not feel the need to assist the tortoise.

In the context of the movie, the question is a tool to explore the themes of empathy, humanity, and the nature of being human. It raises philosophical questions about what distinguishes humans from artificial beings and the role of emotions in defining one's humanity.",true,,0,0,1.0,,
