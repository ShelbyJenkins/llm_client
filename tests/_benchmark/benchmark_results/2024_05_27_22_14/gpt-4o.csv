4318,boolean,"If you ran a rope around the entire circumference of the earth, and wanted to raise it 1 meter off the ground, everywhere, you would only need 6.3 meters of extra rope.",true,true,true,,2,2,1.0,"The answer is: true.

Justification: The circumference of a circle is given by \( C = 2\pi r \). If the radius is increased by 1 meter, the new circumference is \( C' = 2\pi (r + 1) \). The difference in circumference is \( C' - C = 2\pi (r + 1) - 2\pi r = 2\pi \). Since \( 2\pi \) is approximately 6.28 meters, you would need about 6.3 meters of extra rope.; The answer is: true.

Justification: The circumference of the Earth (C) is approximately 40,075 kilometers. If you add 1 meter uniformly to the radius (R), the new circumference (C') is calculated with the formula C' = 2π(R + 1). Subtracting the original circumference, the difference in length is C' - C = 2π(R + 1) - 2πR = 2π meters, which is approximately 6.28 meters. Hence, raising the rope by 1 meter would indeed require around 6.3 meters of extra rope.",LogitBias

There is no evidence or legal statute that indicates it is illegal to cross the North Dakota-Minnesota border with a duck on your head. This appears to be a myth or a piece of trivia without legal backing.; There are no known federal or state laws in North Dakota or Minnesota specifically making it illegal to cross the border with a duck on your head.

Bananas and avocados are considered berries based on the botanical definition, which classifies a berry as a fruit produced from the ovary of a single flower with seeds embedded in the flesh. On the other hand, strawberries and blackberries do not fit this botanical definition of a berry.

While broccoli is a good source of vitamin C, lemons generally contain a higher concentration of vitamin C per 100 grams.; The answer is: false.

While broccoli is a good source of vitamin C, it does not contain more vitamin C than lemons. Lemons have a higher vitamin C content by weight.; Typically, 100 grams of broccoli contain about 89 mg of vitamin C, while 100 grams of lemon contain about 53 mg of vitamin C.

This is a subjective opinion rather than a factual statement. The use of coconuts instead of real horses is a distinctive comedic element that contributes to the film's unique humor and charm.; The answer is: false. 

Whether ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"" would have been a better film if real horses had been used is a subjective opinion, but a core aspect of the movie's humor and charm comes from its use of absurd and nonsensical elements, such as the coconuts.

Oxford University is one of the oldest universities in the world, with evidence of teaching as far back as 1096. The Aztec Empire, however, was established around the 14th century, specifically in 1428. Therefore, Oxford University predates the Aztec Empire by several centuries.; true",LogitBias
7158,boolean,"An 18"" pizza is less pizza than two 12"" pizzas.",false,true,false,,2,3,0.6666667,"The answer is: true.

Justification: The area of a circle is calculated using the formula A = πr². For an 18"" pizza, the radius is 9 inches, so the area is π * 9² = 81π square inches. For a 12"" pizza, the radius is 6 inches, so the area of one 12"" pizza is π * 6² = 36π square inches. Two 12"" pizzas would have a combined area of 2 * 36π = 72π square inches. Therefore, an 18"" pizza (81π square inches) is more pizza than two 12"" pizzas (72π square inches).; The answer is: true. 

The area of a pizza is given by the formula for the area of a circle, A = πr². 

For an 18"" pizza:
r = 18/2 = 9 inches
Area = π(9)² = 81π square inches

For a 12"" pizza:
r = 12/2 = 6 inches
Area = π(6)² = 36π square inches

For two 12"" pizzas:
Total area = 2 * 36π = 72π square inches

Since 81π > 72π, an 18"" pizza is less area than two 12"" pizzas.; The answer is: true. 

The area of an 18"" pizza, assuming it is a circle, can be calculated as π*(9)^2 which is approximately 254.47 square inches. 
Each 12"" pizza has an area of π*(6)^2 which is approximately 113.10 square inches. 
Two 12"" pizzas combined have an area of roughly 226.19 square inches. 

Since 254.47 square inches > 226.19 square inches, an 18"" pizza represents a larger total area of pizza than two 12"" pizzas.",LogitBias
