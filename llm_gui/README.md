# Development

Your new bare-bones project includes minimal organization with a single `main.rs` file and a few assets.

### Serving Your App

Run the following command in the root of your project to start developing with the default platform:

```bash
dx serve
```

To run for a different platform, use the `--platform platform` flag. E.g.
```bash
dx serve --platform desktop
```
