# From AI Vibes to the Deterministic Real World

llm_client is an interface for building cascading prompt workflows from dynamic and novel inputs, running the steps of the workflows in a linear or reactive manner, and constraining and interpreting LLM inference as actionable signals. This allows the integration of LLMs into traditional software systems with the level of consistency and reliability that users expect.

I have a full breakdown of this workflow in my blog post, "[Step-Based Cascading Prompts: Deterministic Signals from the LLM Vibe Space](https://shelbyjenkins.github.io/blog/cascade-prompt/)."
